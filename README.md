# Ferdinand

Ferdinand explores your project dependencies for interesting data.

## Exploring with Ferdinand

For the now the process isn't too elegant. Download the source code, compile, and drag your project's top level folder on to `Ferdinand.CLI.exe`. This will create a text file named `ferdinand-report.txt` containing your project's dependencies sorted by name, then version descending.

### Supported Dependencies

Currently, Ferdinand supports NuGet dependencies and Node dependencies.
